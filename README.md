Python Program to Build a Calculator using OOP



Problem: Write a Python program to create a simple calculator i.e a calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functionality using object-oriented programming (OOP).

To create a basic calculator in python  first i create a class and define different functionalities like addition, subtraction, etc into separate methods.

After that, I will ask the user to choose what functionality they want to execute through an input, then the user will input the required variables and the respective function will be called to compute the result.
